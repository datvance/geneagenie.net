                    Church, Newton, Kansas, circa 1895.</p></div>
                <p>Ferdinand John Robert Heisig was born in Leobshutz, Germany in 1833. At 22, Ferdinand heard his
                  calling to the ministry and was licensed at the Berlin Church, Germany in 1855. He emigrated to
                  England in 1856 and married Elisa Marie Bock (or Bach) in 1858.  He graduated from Regent&#8217;s Park
                  College, London in 1864, became ordained at the German Missionary Church in London on January 3, 1866,
                  and pastored there from 1865 to 1870. Ferdinand and Elisa Marie had eight children in London before
                  they came to the United States. (The children are listed below.)</p>
                <p>His wife, Elisa Marie Bock (or Bach), was probably born in Paris; her family was said to be from
                  Alsace-Lorraine. The correct spelling of her maiden name is unknown; the record for the ship on which
                  the Heisigs came to the U.S. shows a fellow traveler who was probably her brother, with name spelled
                  (Johan) Bock, but family lore said she played the piano excellently and was descended from the great
                  Bach musical family. She may have gone by Eliza Maria, or one or both while in Europe; some records,
                  including family notes, have her as Eliza, and one child was given that name.  She spoke French and
                  German and never conquered English.  She was very small and had brown hair.</p>
                <p>The Heisigs came to the U.S. in 1870.  Ferdinand&#8217;s purpose was to carry his German Baptist
                  ministry to central Texas near Brenham, where many German immigrants had settled. The family of
                  ten traveled on the SS City of London from Liverpool, landing in New York August 2, 1870. Family lore
                  says they also traveled to Galveston by ship.   As mentioned below, sadly one child, Florence Eliza,
                  traveling as an infant, died only a few weeks after arriving in the United States at the age of
                  one.</p>

                <p>In February 1871, Ferdinand Heisig co-purchased the <a title="Former Sam Houston homesite"
                                                                          href="http://www.independencetx.com/SamHoustonHomesite.htm">former
                  homesite of General Sam Houston</a>, in Independence, Washington County, Texas.  He sold it less than
                  two years later, on December 23, 1872. On January 9, 1873, Ferdinand purchased 70 acres on Tommelson
                  Creek in the <a title="Historic Cedar Hill, Texas"
                                  href="http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hvcaw">Cedar Hill
                    community</a>, near the German Baptist Church where he served as pastor from at least 1872 until
                  1879.  According to <a
                      href="../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/History_of_Texas_Baptists-p.293.pdf"><span
                      style="text-decoration: underline;">History of Texas Baptists</span> p.293</a>, this was only the
                  second German Baptist Church in Texas (with the first being the Ebenezer German Baptist Church in
                  Greenvine, Washington County, where Ferdinand also preached). The Cedar Hill church is no longer
                  standing. In July of 1873, the 10th child to Ferdinand and Elisa Marie was born, but in September both
                  mother and baby Esther died 5 days apart. Both are buried in the Heisig cemetery located on this Cedar
                  Hill property.</p>

                    Morning News, July 27, 1905</p></div>
                <p>After Cedar Hill, Ferdinand headed north where he held pastorships at St. Paul, Minnesota, 1879 to
                  1880; at the 2nd German Baptist Church, New York, New York, 1880 to 1886; at Houston, Texas, 1886 to
                  1892; at Newton, Kansas, 1892 to 1899; and finally, at Denton, Texas from 1900 until he retired. He
                  was actively involved in the German Baptist and Texas Baptist state organizations. He attended their
                  association meetings and state conventions and gave sermons or the opening prayer at such events. He
                  was also a Moderator of the German Conference of Baptist Churches and a member of that
                  organization.</p>
                <p>In <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flowers and Fruits in the Wilderness,</span> published
                  in 1872, the author stated, “Two years ago Elder F. Heisig came to Texas, leaving the pastorate of a
                  German congregation in London, England, and has since been giving to the German mission the benefits
                  of his talents and energies. As a Baptist, he makes no compromise with error. He is in possession of a
                  clear and discriminating mind, has enjoyed the benefits of a thorough education, and is eminently
                  qualified to oppose those systems of error that have taken such a deep hold upon the German mind. He
                  is under the patronage of the mission board of Union Association, and while he preaches with great
                  power in his native tongue, preaches also acceptably in English.”</p>
                <p>After Elisa Marie’s death, Reverend Heisig married Sophie Breihan in July 1874.  They had a child,
                  Lillie, in 1876.  Sophie died December 16, 1877, and is also buried in the Heisig cemetery on the

                <p>Ferdinand married his third wife, Johanna Menten, on October 15, 1885 in Union, New Jersey. She was
                  born in Emmden Germany on July 17, 1844 and died March 8, 1921.  They had no children.  As of 1910
                  Ferdinand and Johanna still lived in Denton City, and he was retired.  Ferdinand died in 1918, at age
                  85, and is buried in Odd Fellows Cemetery in Denton County, Texas.</p>
                <p>It was said that Ferdinand was a strict father, dogmatic, domineering and ruled the purse strings.
                  The family spoke German, French and later English. Most of Ferdinand’s sermons were in German. All of
                  his children were ambitious, worked hard from childhood and became successful. His two entrepreneurial
                  sons Paul and CT offered to invest money for Ferdinand, but he would only agree if the money was used
                  after his death to build a church in the German village where he was born.  It is not known whether
                  this ever occurred.</p>

                <p>1.  D<a title="Dr. Theodore Heisig (1859-1929)" href="../../dr-theo-heisig/">r. Theodore Heisig</a>,
                  born April 4, 1859, London, England; married Anna Hammann;  died  Nov. 7, 1929.</p>
                <p>Dr. Theodore Heisig graduated from Baylor University in 1882, while it was located in Independence,
                  Texas<strong> </strong>and became a Baptist preacher like his father.  He also attended Rochester
                  Theological Seminary in New York where he obtained a degree in 1888.  He was ordained at Waterford,
                  New York and pastored churches throughout the north and south United States including New York and New
                  Jersey.  He was also a teacher at Baylor College at Independence for some time.</p>
                <p>His wife Anna was born Anna Von Hammann on June 5, 1862; she died August 21, 1951 and is buried at
                  Magnolia Cemetery, Beaumont, Texas. She was also a teacher at Baylor College at Independence.   Family
                  notes said they met in Germany when Theodore returned to visit; however, the 1920 Baylor yearbook
                  entry for Mrs. Anna Heisig states “She with her brother came as a young girl to Baylor at Independence
                  from their home in Germany. In a most remarkable way, she adapted herself to Texas customs. She
                  learned English so perfectly that she would never be considered one of foreign birth. After a few
                  years she and her brother became teachers in Baylor College. In 1888 they visited their home in
                  Germany and took with them another Baylor Teacher. Mention should be made of Dr. Theodore Heisig, who
                  was also a teacher in Baylor College at Independence.  He has been a most generous contributor to the
                  Baylor College loan fund, and never fails to respond to an appeal for Christian Education.”</p>
                <p>Children of Theodore and Anna:</p>
                <p>a.Elsa Heisig McLane (1892-1977).  Born in New York.  She married Alan McLane and had a son Alan, Jr.
                  who was raised in Louisiana and died in Houston in 1993.</p>
                <ol>b. Theodore Heisig Jr. (1897-1970).  Born in New Jersey while his father was pastor there, married
                  Marie (maiden name unknown) and worked as an executive at Texaco for years, living in both Texas and
                  New York area. He died in Baytown, buried Forest Park Cemetery, Houston. Two children Anna and Charles
                  Theodore (“Ted”).

                  in Magnolia Cemetery, Beaumont.  [Note his birth record in England gives his name as Ferdinand John

                  Heisig.]</p>
                <p>In 1880 Ferdinand Jr. worked on a farm in Fayette County.  In 1900 he, wife Nellie and daughter

                  County. As of 1940 they had 3 sons and were living in Liberty County, Texas.</p>

                  born about 1863 and died Feb 7, 1941 in Houston.)  Both are buried in Glenwood Cemetery.</p>
                <p>Ernest was a physician in Houston, Texas from at least 1892 and practiced there for many years.</p>

                  was Latin for “City of God”.]</p>
                <p>CT moved to Beaumont around 1898 and became a successful real estate investor.  He built the Heisig
                  Hotel, owned the Heisig Storage Company, the Beaumont Coca-Cola Company, part of the Gray
                  Building, helped found Gulf Steel Company (later Lone Star Steel Company) and was a director of
                  Citizen’s National Bank.  In 1901 he was one of the founders and first secretary of the Higgins Oil
                  Company which drilled at Spindletop and found the second major gusher; it was later absorbed by a
                  larger company. CT spent a great deal of money and time backing agricultural enterprises in southeast
                  Texas and at the time of his death he owned a rice farm and a large fig farm.  In 1903 CT was listed
                  in the Houston Post’s publication of “Men of Texas: A collection of portraits of men who deserve to
