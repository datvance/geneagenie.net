					<description><![CDATA[Hi - I am Rachel Scott Vance&#039;s Great, great, great grandson and have some old family pictures that I would love to share with you.  I have a wonderful photo in -  great shape - of around the same time period as the one above where she is standing in a dress.  

The photo is of her and James Vance seated and sitting side by side.  

In addition I have a great deal of photos from James son Josiah Scott Vance - who ended up in Caddo County Oklahoma.  Please let me know where i can send these images to you.

Thanks for all the great work you have done.  I am just now getting very interested in the genealogy of the Vance family - and have done several small searches to see what I can find -  It was a wonderful surprise to see some great images of my great, great, great grandmother :).  

Thanks, Scott A. Vance.]]></description>
